   <br><h1>Last Mile Execution </h1>
   <h3 class="Subheadline">A journal to execute fast!</h3><br><br>
   <h2>1. What is the last mile execution about?</h2>
   <p> There is a task in front of you at work, and you struggle to get it done because you either: </p>
   <h4>
       <li> Don’t know how to get it done </li><br>
       <li> You have no tight deadline to get it done fast </li><br>
       <li> Or if you get it done, it’s mediocre at best, because you lack skills</li>
   </h4>
   <p>It all comes down to, you're slow in execution, thus having a hard time making progress with your
   company, career ... <br><br> There is a simple idea that follows 4 steps based on neuroscience research and 100s of iterations in the daily work of startups. <br><br> The beauty of this simple
   approach is that it does not matter what kind of task you have, if it is large, small, in engineering,
      marketing, complex, or simple. </p>
   <br>
   <h2>2. Set a specific goal: Get focus, thus speed!</h2>
   <p> You want to work as fast as possible. Instead of thinking about all the things you need to do, you focus only on the next 25 minutes. What should you do (specific goal) in the next 25 minutes to get closer to finishing the task? No "smart" goals here, just a specific goal you want to reach in the next 25 minutes.
      <br><br>Why 25 minutes? Is short enough to keep a good attention span, it’s simple to start with and if you work on something wrong, you stop after 25 minutes and see if you are on the right track.
      <br><br>(Solves Problem = no tight deadline to get it done) </p>
   <br><h2>3.  Note Down Challenges in the next 25 minutes: Triple your amount of progress!</h2>
   <p>Some tasks are tricky and overwhelm you. You might think, "I do not know where to start". Just write down what might block or distract you.
      As soon as you are in the 25 minutes and hit a roadblock, you are mentally prepared for it and instead of stopping, it will be easy to find a solution.
   <br><br>(Solves Problem = don’t know how to get it done)</p>
   <h2><br>4. Write Execution Steps: An algorithmic approach!</h2>
   <p>For easy tasks, skip this, but when you are not yet proficient in solving the task, write down the steps to reach the minimum version to solve the goal, nothing more.
      After you have done this, go to the second simple version to finish the task. You start adding more and more complexity, layer by layer to get closer to a solution that satisfies your standards.
      <br><br>(Solves Problem = don’t know how to get it done)</p>
   <br><h2>5. Give Feedback: Improve our skills 4 times per day, 960 times per year!</h2>
   <p>This is the last step that lets you go from mediocre to excellent. You stop every 25 minutes and reflect for 1 minute on your performance of the previous 25 minutes. You look at your process and your quality of work.
   <br><li>Example Process Reflection: I slacked off because I did not have a specific goal.</li>
   <br><li>Example Quality Reflection: I missed a plausibility check in my calculation. Or that where not the most critical parts to get it done </li></p>
   <p>(Solves Problem = if you get it done, it’s mediocre at best because you lack skills)</p>
   <br><h2>6. Some tactical information</h2>
   <h3>It is NOT a task management tool!</h3>
   <p>There are great software solutions for task management tools, use them. The Last Mile Execution is to execute your tasks, not to keep track of them.</p>
   <h3>Why Levels? Be persistence!</h3>
   <p>Tick off a circle after 25 minutes when you at least filled out the goal and feedback. This is one means to pat yourself for your great progress and increase your dopamine. Without dopamine, it’s hard to stay motivated for the long haul.
      <br><br>(Solves Problem =  no tight deadline to get it done) </p>
   <p>
   <h3>Why 25 Minutes? Several daily feedback loops!</h3>
   <p>You correct your quality of work and what you work for every 25 minutes. You might focus on the wrong thing or have low quality, you can correct it not after days but after 25 minutes.
      If your task is quite easy, move up to 55 minutes with 15 minutes break per round and only state the goal and do feedback, leave out the challenge and execution steps.</p>
   <h3>How to keep track of the 25 minutes?</h3>
   <p>To keep the time, there are plenty of free Pomodoro extensions for any web browser, just google, “Pomodoro extension “.
