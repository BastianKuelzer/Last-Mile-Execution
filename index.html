      <h1>Last Mile Execution️ </h1>
         <h2>What is the last mile execution about?</h2>
            <p> You lack execution speed in your work because you either:
               <ul><h4><li>Don’t know how to get it done</li><br></br>
               <li>You have no tight deadline to get it done fast</li><br></br>
               <li>Or if you get it done, it’s mediocre at best, because you lack skills</li></h4></ul>
            It all comes down to, you are slow in execution, thus have a hard time to make progress with your company, career ...
            There is a simple idea that taps into neuroscience research and went through 100s of iterations in the daily work of startups to let you execute fast. The beauty of this simple approach is, it does not matter what kind of task you have, if it is large, small, in engineering, marketing, or complex, simple.
               <br></br> <h2>Why it works 1/2</h2>
                  <h3>Why Specific & Ambitious Goals? Get focus, thus speed!</h3>
            If you are not sure what to do in the next 25 minutes, you won’t get somewhere - the specific goal gives you focus, thus speed.  In addition those goals should be challenging. If it’s too easy, your goals might not have an effect at all. So "do your best goals, or no goals”
            (Solves Problem = no tight deadline to get it done)
               <h3>Why Challenges? Triple your amount of progress!</h3>
         The moment the task seems overwhelming or you might slack off. Just write down what might block or distract you. As soon as you are in the 25 minutes and hit the roadblock/ get distracted, you expected this and have a clear mind to find a workaround.
         (Solves Problem = don’t know how to get it done)</p><br></br>
               <h2>Why it works 2/2</h2>
                  <h3>Why Execution Steps? Or make a plan!</h3>
         Most tasks that we give ourselves are too big, so either
         we don’t know how to solve them. Breaking down the problem to the simplest version, and afterward adding one layer of complexity let you solve complex tasks fast.
         Or we get parts of the task done but not the most critical parts, thus we work ineffective. We want to satisfy not optimize!
         (Solves Problem = don’t know how to get it done)
               <h3>Why Feedback? Improve our skills every day!</h3>
         We want to build up speed and quality of our work. You stop every 25 minutes and reflect on the process to be faster and on  the quality of our work to go from mediocre to excellent.</p>
         Example Process Reflection: I slacked off because I did not have a specific goal
         Example Quality Reflection: I missed a plausibility check in my calculation.
         (Solves Problem = if you get it done, it’s mediocre at best, because you lack skills)
               <br></br><h2>Some tactical information</h2>
                  <h3>It is NOT a task management tool!</h3>
         There are great software solutions for task management tools, use them. The Last Mile Execution is to execute your tasks, not to keep track of them.
               <h3>Why Levels? Be persistence!</h3>
      Tick off a circle after 25 minutes when you at least filled out the goal and feedback. This is one mean to pat yourselve for your great progress and increase your dopmaine. Without dopamine, it’s hard to stay motivated for the long haul.
      (Solves Problem =  no tight deadline to get it done)

               <h3>Why 25 Minutes? Several daily feedback loops!</h3>
      You correct your quality of work and on what you work every 25 minutes. You might focus on the wrong thing or have low quality, you can correct it not after days but after 25 minutes.
      If your task is quite easy, move up to 55 minutes with 15 minutes break per round and only state the goal and do a feedback, leave out the challenge and execution steps.
               <h3>How to keep track of the 25 minutes?</h3>
      To keep the time, there are plenty of free pomodoro extensions for any webbroser, just google, “pomodore extension “. E.g for chrome <a herf="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef?hl=en">Click here</a></p>
